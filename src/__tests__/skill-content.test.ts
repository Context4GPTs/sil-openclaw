/**
 * INTEGRATION — skill discoverability + the progressive-disclosure split
 * (tier: integration — reads the real skill/ files from disk and compares
 * their bodies against the set of registered tool names and the pinned
 * procedure invariants; multiple artifacts interacting, the skill-doc ↔
 * registration seam and the SKILL.md-router ↔ reference-files seam).
 *
 * Named `skill-content.test.ts` to mirror the reference adapter's file
 * of the same name. The skill is authored as a progressive-disclosure
 * bundle (skill-creator convention): a MAXIMALLY-LEAN `skill/SKILL.md` pure
 * router plus detailed procedures under `skill/references/` and a worked example
 * under `skill/examples/`. So content this file pins lives in the file that now
 * OWNS it:
 *   - the router (intent→tool→reference) lives in `skill/SKILL.md` — it NAMES
 *     every registered tool and routes, but holds NO per-tool detail;
 *   - the four core tools' per-tool behaviour + the shared status taxonomy live
 *     in `skill/references/catalog_tools_reference.md`;
 *   - the brainstorm interview procedure lives in
 *     `skill/references/brainstorm_interview.md`;
 *   - the agent-creation engine lives in
 *     `skill/references/agent_creation_engine.md`;
 *   - the answer→sil_search-param mapping lives in
 *     `skill/references/search_param_mapping.md`;
 *   - the worked end-to-end example lives in `skill/examples/`.
 *
 * Frontmatter is parsed with a small self-contained extractor (no
 * gray-matter dependency assumed — the skeleton's dep set is minimal)
 * that still REJECTS a malformed frontmatter block: a missing closing
 * fence, an empty block, or absent keys all fail. Adversarial intent:
 * "frontmatter parses" must mean structurally valid, not merely present.
 *
 * Contract this file pins for the implementation (expert-developer):
 *   skill/SKILL.md has a valid `--- ... ---` YAML frontmatter block at
 *   the top with non-empty `name:` and `description:` scalars, a body
 *   that mentions each registered sil_* tool by name and routes to the
 *   reference/example files (every `references/…` / `examples/…` path it
 *   names exists on disk); the references hold the procedure detail —
 *   including the four core tools' per-tool behaviour + the shared status
 *   taxonomy in `references/catalog_tools_reference.md` (NOT inline in the
 *   router); and the runtime skill carries NO contributor-facing
 *   "adding a tool" prose.

 * follows — there is NO new plugin tool, NO code path — so the reference body IS
 * the spec, exactly as it is for the engine. These never fake a transcript: "a
 * real agent runs a genuinely good interview" is `live-verification`'s job, NOT
 * a test tier. We pin the procedure's load-bearing invariants:
 *   - SC1: open, multi-turn, TWO-SIDED interview (domain attributes AND the
 *     user's own tastes/style/budget/constraints), explicitly NOT a form-fill;
 *     all FIVE converged sections named;
 *   - narrow-first gate: a vague/over-broad domain is narrowed WITH the user
 *     BEFORE persona/mapping/rubric (ordering anchor);
 *   - per-section converge + re-entrant (reflect-back + confirm; collaborative);
 *   - SC2 tailoring: persona + answer→param mapping + rubric reflect STATED
 *     inputs; the mapping names REAL sil_search params; ship_to left EMPTY by
 *     default (no sil_whoami round-trip);
 *   - endorsement-before-creation: an endorse/confirm token PRECEDES the first
 *     engine step (`openclaw agents add` / `sil_profile_materialize`) — ZERO
 *     engine steps before explicit endorsement (ordering anchor, now pinned in
 *     the interview reference that owns the endorsement gate);
