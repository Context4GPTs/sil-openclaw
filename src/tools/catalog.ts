/**
 * Catalog tools for the sil plugin.
 *
 * `sil_search` is a thin, typed product-discovery tool. An AI agent sends a
 * SIMPLIFIED structured query — free-text `query` plus optional filters
 * (`category`, `price_min`/`price_max`) and pagination (`cursor`/`limit`) — and
 * gets back a flat, ranked list of purchasable options: one featured variant per
 * product projected to `{ id, title, price, availability, checkout_url, source }`,
 * plus an opaque pagination `cursor`. The agent builds no UCP envelope and fills
 * no defaults; sil-api owns enrichment, ranking, and the envelope. The tool's job
 * is: validate the one invariant it owns (≥1 input), attach the stored Bearer
 * token, POST the bare `/catalog/search` on sil-api, and normalize the response.
 *
 * `execute()` flow (ALL I/O here; `register()` opens nothing — search is a
 * synchronous request/response, NOT a poll):
 *   1. Not registered (no stored tokens) → terminal `not_registered` + a
 *      `recovery: sil_register` hint, ZERO network calls (nothing to authenticate
 *      with). Mirrors `sil_whoami`'s not-registered path.
 *   2. Client-side input guard: a request with neither a non-empty `query` nor
 *      any filter is rejected with a structured validation error and makes NO
 *      network call (sil-api's `empty_search_input` 400 is the authoritative
 *      backstop). A filter-only request (e.g. `category` alone) is a valid browse.
 *   3. searchCatalog(getApiUrl(), token, params) → map the `SearchOutcome`:
 *        ok            → the ranked products + cursor;
 *        invalid_request (400) → surface sil-api's `{ error, message }`;
 *        unauthorized  (401)   → refresh-and-retry ONCE via the shared
 *                                `refreshAndRetryOnce` choreography (sil-web refresh,
 *                                re-read rotated pair, retry once). The agent never
 *                                sees a recovered 401; a second 401 or a dead refresh
 *                                is terminal re-register (tokens cleared); a refresh
 *                                5xx/network blip is transient "try again". 401
 *                                recovery is UNIFORM across sil_search /
 *                                sil_product_get / sil_whoami — never per-tool;
 *        retryable (5xx/net)   → transient "try again", NO re-register hint.
 *
 * The three distinct sil-api outcomes (empty match 200 / invalid 400 / source
 * failure 500) surface as three DISTINGUISHABLE agent envelopes — an empty match
 * is a SUCCESS (`status: "ok"`, `products: []`), never an error. Distinct recovery
 * hints per error class, mirroring `identity.ts`: re-register sends the agent to
 * `sil_register`; a transient/invalid must NOT (re-registering can't fix a 5xx or
 * a bad query and would derail the user).
 *
 * Privacy: the access token and Bearer header never reach a log line or the
 * result; logs carry only non-credential status markers (search params are not
 * credentials, but are not logged either — nothing here needs them).
 *
 * `register()` stays synchronous and side-effect-free beyond registering tools —
 * no fetch, no timer, no unawaited promise. All I/O is inside `execute()`.

/**
 * `sil_product_get` — the lookup COMPANION to `sil_search`. The agent passes ids
 * it already holds (from a prior `sil_search`, a saved list, deep links, or cart
 * validation) and gets back the matching products in UCP shape, each with its
 * FRESH featured variant `{ id, title, price, availability, checkout_url, ... }`.
 * RICH where search is LEAN: lookup adds the description, the variant's options,
 * and — its defining feature — the per-variant `inputs` correlation, because the
 * response does NOT preserve request order and one id can resolve to a variant of
 * another id's product. The agent builds no envelope and fills no defaults; the
 * tool sends just `{ ids }`, sil-api owns enrichment + the `not_found` messaging.
 *
 * `execute()` flow (ALL I/O here; `register()` opens nothing — a synchronous
 * request/response, NOT a poll). MIRRORS `sil_search` and shares its taxonomy:
 *   1. Not registered (no stored tokens) → terminal `not_registered` + a
 *      `recovery: sil_register` hint, ZERO network calls. Mirrors `sil_whoami`.
 *   2. Client-side guard: an empty `ids` (after dropping non-strings) is rejected
 *      with a structured validation error and NO network call (sil-api's
 *      `minItems:1` schema 400 is the authoritative backstop).
 *   3. lookupCatalog(getApiUrl(), token, ids) → map the `LookupOutcome`:
 *        ok            → the resolved products + the `not_found` id list (a PARTIAL
 *                        or ALL-MISSED hit is `status:"ok"` — a SUCCESS, never an
 *                        error, with NO recovery hint: re-running won't conjure a
 *                        delisted product);
 *        invalid_request (400) → surface sil-api's `{ error, message }`;
 *        unauthorized  (401)   → refresh-and-retry ONCE via the shared
 *                                `refreshAndRetryOnce` choreography (parity with
 *                                `sil_search` and `sil_whoami` — 401 recovery is
 *                                uniform). Recovered 401 is invisible; second 401 /
 *                                dead refresh is terminal re-register (tokens
 *                                cleared); a refresh 5xx/network blip is transient;
 *        retryable (5xx/net)   → transient "try again", NO re-register hint.
 *
 * The unfound-ids outcome is the headline: a lookup that resolves SOME (or NONE)
 * of its ids is a success the agent relays ("3 of your 4 items are still
 * available; 1 is no longer listed"), distinguished from the two true-error
 * classes (not-registered/401 and source/transport failure) by DISTINCT recovery
 * hints. One wrong hint = one misdirected user.
 *
 * Privacy + freshness: the access token and Bearer header never reach a log line
 * or the result; the products are always live-fetched (never cached — freshness is
 * the reason this tool exists; a cached `checkout_url`/price is a broken purchase).
